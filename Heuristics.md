"10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" by Jakob Nielsen

1. Visibility of system status
    * Inform users about current process
    * Feedback within reasonable time

2. Match between system and real world
    * Speak users' language, ie. words, phrases, concepts familiar to user
    * Info appears naturally and logically

3. User control and freedom
    * Clearly marked "emergency exit"
    * Undo and redo

4. Consistency and standards
    * No ambiguity in words, situations, actions, etc.

5. Error prevention
    * Careful design that prevents problems
    * Check/eliminate error-prone conditions
    * User confirmation for actions

6. Recognition rather than recall
    * Minimize user memory load by making things visual:
	* objects
	* actions
	* options
    * Visible/retrievable instructions

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
    * Allow experienced users to tailor frequent actions

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
    * Remove irrelevant or rarely needed dialogue
    * Remove units that diminish visibility or information

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
    * Plain language error messages
	* Precisely indicate problem
	* Constructively suggest solution

10. Help and documentation
    * Better if system can be used w/o, but should be:
    	* Easy to search
    	* Focused on user's task list
    	* List concrete steps to carry out
    	* Small size
